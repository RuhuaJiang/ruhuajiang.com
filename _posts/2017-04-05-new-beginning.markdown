Few days ago, I decided to move my personal blog to use [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). I spent few hours on a Saturday get everthing working together.  The whole thing is hosted on [Github](https://github.com/RuhuaJiang/ruhuajiang.com) if you want to check the source. 

I am using minima Jekyll theme, with some customization such as integration with Google analytics, Disqus and my tweets. Using cloudflare (github.io using fastly for cdn) for https support.I will add some other features along the way.  

Now everything all set up,  let's start the new journey ...
