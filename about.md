Welcome!  

I'am Ruhua Jiang, a software engineer. <a href="https://twitter.com/RuhuaJiang" class="twitter-follow-button" data-show-count="false">Follow @RuhuaJiang</a><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

I have been working for <a href="https://www.akamai.com/">Akamai Technologies </a>on data infrastructure since my graduation at summer 2015. We do very cool system design there, handling *real huge* data. Before that, I live in a little town called Storrs in Connecticut, where I got my Master of CS from University of Connecticut(Go Huskies!).   I have a B.E. in CS from  <a href="http://www.xjtu.edu.cn/"> Xi'an Jiaotong University</a>. Oh, I also enjoyed a great summer at Seattle in 2014 interning at Amazon eCommerce Platform :)
